### Prismic.io Website Starter for NodeJS

This application is a "batteries included", ready to use website and blog engine. It is designed with document types similar to existing CMS like Wordpress, **blog posts** and **pages**.

#### Getting started

* Download the [latest release]()
* Unzip locally or on your server
* Modify `prismic-configuration.js` by adding your API end point by changing `apiEndpoint` and if needed `accessToken`.
* That's it!

To run it on your local machine, 2 possibilities:

* In command line: node app

Some remarks:

* Your repository must be a clone of http://prismicwebsite.me. You can modify the default document masks, but that may require adapting the NodeJS source code.
